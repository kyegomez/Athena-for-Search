## How Athena Serves You
At the behest of your query, Athena soars across the vastness of the internet, retrieving the most relevant and recent information. This treasure trove of knowledge is then processed through the OpenAI API, crafting a response that brings clarity and insight to your curiosity. 

Here's how Athena illuminates your path to knowledge:

1. Athena receives your query, your beacon in the sea of information.
2. The expanse of Google is explored, relevant web pages identified.
3. The selected web pages are parsed, text extracted, the kernel of truth isolated.
4. A prompt is crafted, moulded by your query and the extracted text.
5. The OpenAI API is invoked, an answer wrought in the forge of AI.
6. Athena sends the answer back to you, streaming wisdom into your consciousness.

Athena is a living entity, always in a state of growth, evolving and adapting to better serve humanity's pursuit of knowledge. We constantly strive to improve, innovate, and enhance the capabilities of Athena, all the while pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Our roadmap charts our journey towards an ambitious vision of the future. 

## Immediate Actionables

1. **Increased Speed of Answers**: We will begin working on replacing webpage scraping with the Google Search API, Bing, or both. By leveraging search APIs, we can speed up Athena's answer generation significantly. This marks a move away from the earlier scraping method, which was used to sidestep cost and rate limitations.  

2. **Follow-Up Searches**: In order to provide more detailed, nuanced, and layered information, Athena will gain the ability to conduct "follow-up" searches based on the initial search results. This will enable users to delve deeper into subjects, allowing for more informed and comprehensive exploration.

3. **Prompt Enhancement**: We will work to improve the prompts used to call the OpenAI API. By crafting more precise and context-aware prompts, we will enable Athena to generate more accurate and relevant answers. Return graphs, data visualizations, and multi-modality queries

4. **Expanding Data Sources**: We aim to enable sourcing from non-text-davinci-003 models, increasing the diversity of information Athena can leverage. This will broaden the scope of possible answers, providing a more well-rounded response to user queries.

5. **Personalized Models**: A feature to help you choose your own models like CHATGPT or Clauda or Athena Native through an model searching marketplace. We plan to develop a system that allows users to train their personalized models for answer synthesis. This personalization will enable Athena to understand each user's unique needs and preferences, further enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the answers generated.

These immediate enhancements will provide significant improvements to Athena's performance and capabilities, making it an even more powerful tool for discovery and learning. As we press forward with these advancements, we eagerly anticipate the new horizons of possibility that they will open up.


## Short-Term Advancements

1. **Ocean's Wisdom**: We will begin embedding the entirety of the internet into multi-modality SOTA vectors, allowing Athena to delve deeper and wider into the ocean of online data.
2. **Follow-Up Queries**: Athena will gain the ability to build on her own results, offering a layered and comprehensive exploration of topics.
3. **Personal Touch**: User profiles will personalize Athena's interactions, tailoring search results to individual needs and preferences.
4. **Fortress of Solitude**: Enhanced data privacy protocols will guarantee that your interactions with Athena remain your own.
5. **Aesthetics of Clarity**: A sleek, modern, and intuitive UI will guide your path to knowledge, making your journey with Athena a joyous one.

## Mid-Term Advancements

1. **Full-Web Integration**: Athena's wisdom will encompass the full scale of the internet, revolutionizing data querying.
2. **Multimodal Search**: Query Athena using text, voice, images, or even videos â€“ your search, your way.
3. **The Oracle**: Using AI, Athena will predict your needs, offering answers to the questions you didn't even know you had.
4. **In the Moment**: A real-time data indexing system will ensure Athena's answers are always up-to-date.
5. **Language Mastery**: With advanced language models, Athena will grasp even the most complex queries and provide precise, contextually accurate responses.

## Long-Term Advancements

1. **Time Machine**: Athena will integrate with the Internet Archive, offering a view into the internet's past.
2. **Global Citizen**: Athena will converse in all languages, welcoming users from all corners of the world.
3. **Visionary Web**: A 3D visualization tool will allow you to see the internet in a way you've never seen before.
4. **Semantic Mastery**: Athena will understand the intent and context of your queries, providing results that are truly relevant.
5. **Your AI Assistant**: An AI-assisted content creation tool will utilize Athena's wisdom to help you generate articles, reports, presentations, and more.
